### Recursion
* Binary Search
* Array is sorted or not
* Number of zeroes in an integer
* Reversing an integer
* Reversing a string
* Given k find the geometric Sum i.e. 1 + 1/2 + 1/4 + 1/8 + ... + 1/(2^k)
* Given two strings check if one is reverse of other
* Write a program to count all the possible paths from top left to
  bottom right of a MXN matrix with the constraints that from each cell you

* Given a String print all the subsets. e.g. for input = abc you need to
  print a, b, c, ab, ac, bc, abc using recursion.
* Given an array and a number N, find all subsets which sum up to N. (pairs,
  triplets, etc.)
